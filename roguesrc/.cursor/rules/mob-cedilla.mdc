The Cedilla (Regular Enemy) Rules:
- DO NOT modify movement pattern (random 8-direction)
- DO NOT modify spawn conditions (floor tiles, 2 per chunk)
- DO NOT modify combat stats (1 hit to kill, 1 damage)
- DO NOT modify spawn timing (1.0 seconds)
- DO NOT modify movement speed (3.0)

Current implementation:
- Moves randomly in 8 directions (including diagonals)
- Spawns on floor tiles ('.')
- Limited to 2 enemies per chunk
- Moves at speed 3.0
- Takes 1 hit to kill
- Deals 1 damage to player on collision
- Spawns every 1.0 seconds
